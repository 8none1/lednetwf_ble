# Beta tests

## How to install a beta version

 1. Open HACS
 2. Locate the LEDnetWF BLE integration and click on it
 3. In the top right corner menu, choose "redownload"
 4. Note the "Need a different version?" drop down, click that and you should see a "Release" drop down
 5. Choose the release tagged "pre release" which should have "beta" in the name
 6. Restart Home Assistant

You might see messages about "upgrading" to the previous release.  Just ignore these while you are testing the beta.

If you notice any bugs please log an issue and ensure that you note that you are running a beta release, and which beta release you are running.
